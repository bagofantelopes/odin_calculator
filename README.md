A simple calculator app done for the Odin Project.
A bit rough around the edges but for the most part I'm happy with how it turned out.
Definitely could use some touching up in future.


Has keyboard support (for the most part). Everything you'd expect to work, will work.
Except * for multiplication. It was really picky about that, so I left it alone.
To use the SIN, LOG, etc. buttons with the keyboard just type them out.
